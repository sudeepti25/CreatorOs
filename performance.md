## **AUDIT REPORT(CreatorOs)**

\-by rima48-bit

- Issue reports 800-900ms load time.
- Local dev builds measured 573ms, but production (Vercel) measured 1.11s-1.37s which is closer to the reported range.
- Lighthouse confirms the gap is worse on mobile (LCP 3.9s, Performance 80) than desktop (LCP 1.8s, Performance 91).
- Server response is fine in both cases (TTFB 40ms desktop, 270ms mobile) the bottleneck is entirely client-side rendering, not backend.

JavaScript execution is the biggest cost.

When Scripting > Rendering, the browser is spending lots of time running JS rather than drawing the page.


Problems flagged:

- _Render blockers_\- these files block the browser from rendering the page immediately, delaying FCP and LCP. Because Browser cannot render page until CSS + fonts are fetched. **Impact** - Fonts block first meaningful paint. Icon font CSS delays rendering entire layout.
- _Font loading bottleneck_\- large font files delay text visibility and contribute to slower perceived loading. **Impact**\- Hero text appears late , Layout shifts when fonts load ,LCP delayed heavily by typography pipeline. Browser is waiting on CSS/fonts/JS before rendering hero text
- _Heavy third party js_\- JavaScript downloaded on initial load but not fully utilized.
- _Chain-_ Resources depend on each other and delay rendering. Because of too many sequential dependencies → browser cannot parallelize early rendering.
- _Excessive external fonts_\- Extra network requests and render delay.
- **HIGHLIGHTED ONES SHOULD BE GIVEN PRIORITY**

## **Optimization Plan**

**PRIORITY 1 - Fix Render Blocking**

**Do this:**

- Inline critical CSS (hero section only)
- Defer FontAwesome
- Replace FontAwesome CDN with:
  - SVG icons OR
  - subset import

**PRIORITY 2 - Kill Font Loading Bottleneck**

**Add:**

&lt;link rel="preconnect" href="<https://fonts.gstatic.com>" crossorigin&gt;

**Reduce:**

- Number of font families
- Number of weights

**PRIORITY 3 - Fix Fonts**

**Change:**

font-display: swap;

**Also:**

- Preload only 1-2 critical fonts
- Remove unused font weights
- Prefer system font for body text

**PRIORITY 4 - JavaScript Optimization**

**Fix:**

- Lazy load three.min.js
- Load only on interaction / scroll
- Split services-hub.js into chunks

**Example:**

if (userInteracts) {  
import('./three.min.js')  
}

**PRIORITY 5 - Reduce Main Thread Work**

- Remove unused JS (~85 KB savings)
- Defer non-critical scripts
- Break long tasks (<50ms chunks)

**PRIORITY 6 - Reduce External Dependencies**

Replace:

- Google Fonts → self-host fonts
- FontAwesome CDN → SVG sprite system
- UNPKG → local bundle or dynamic import

**PRIORITY 7 - Improve LCP**

Target:

- Move render delay: **3130 ms → <1000 ms**

Fix by:

- Prioritizing hero HTML + CSS
- Removing font blocking
- Reducing JS in initial bundle

**Accessibility & Best Practices Notes (Simple Explanation)**

The score is 92/100 which is good but these are additional changes. (not mandatory)

- The page is missing a proper "main content" section marker. This does not affect most users, but it can make navigation harder for people who use screen readers to browse the website.
- Some links that lead to the same page are labeled differently. Using consistent link names helps users understand where a link will take them and improves accessibility.
- A few footer text elements have low color contrast against the background, which may make them difficult to read for users with visual impairments or when viewing the site in certain lighting conditions.

These are minor accessibility improvements and do not affect the website's core functionality. The site remains fully usable, but addressing these items would improve accessibility, user experience, and overall Lighthouse scores.

Also add meta descriptions to pages if not added.
